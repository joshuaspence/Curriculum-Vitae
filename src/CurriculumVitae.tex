My main role within the team was working on improving the reliability and 
accuracy of the operations of the team by designing software-based tools to 
allow them to monitor and analyse data. I analysed and reconstructed several 
macro-enabled spreadsheets used by the team to perform important calculations. I
was able to improve the accuracy of the data reported by the spreadsheet and 
greatly improve the running speeds of the tools.}

\professionalExperience{February 2009}{February 2009}
{Industrial Student}{Energy Australia}
{I was involved with the Intelligent Networks division, working on an electrical
sensing and monitoring system. I was involved with analysing system diagrams and

a hazard to the public or the surroundings; as well as many other 
responsibilities.

In addition to my role as a pyrotechnician, I am also a pyrotechnic display
