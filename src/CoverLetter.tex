\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}

I write this letter in application of the advertised position.

I feel that I would be a suitable candidate for this position due to my 
experience in the fields of both computer engineering and computer science, as 
well as my professional work attitude and my commitment to learning and 
teamwork.

I am currently studying Electrical Engineering (Computer) and Science (Computer 
Science) at The University of Sydney. I will graduate from this double degree at
the end of 2012. I am currently on track to, and aiming towards, graduating from
my degree with First Class Honours. After graduation, I hope to pursue a 
challenging and rewarding career in the field of computer science, applying my 
skills and knowledge to complex problems.

I have achieved a distinction average throughout my university studies and still
have two semesters to complete. I have, during my degree, completed advanced 
mathematics and computer science units and have proved myself to be capable of 
performing well in these areas. Additionally, whilst studying full-time at 
university, I have maintained a very active lifestyle consisting of work, 
exercise and extra-curricular activities. I am currently completing a thesis 
research project, the topic of which is ``Implementation of a Random Projection 
Algorithm using FPGA Hardware''. The prospect of working for an established 
company such as \company{} is appealing to me and I feel that I could apply my 
skills to the position being offered. I also feel that I would benefit greatly 
from such an experience.

I have always been a hard working and motivated student and I am always ready to
face challenges. I work well in team environments and possess a number of 
leadership qualities. I am an intelligent individual who isn't constrained by 
conventional thinking and strives to make my unique contribution to the field in
which I am working. I believe that all of these qualities make me an ideal
candidate for this position. I am willing and eager to learn new skills and 
apply them in a fast‚Äêpaced learning environment. I am also more than happy to 
undertake any extra training which you would deem to be necessary for this 
position.

Please contact me for an interview on \myMobile{} at your convenience. I look 
forward to the opportunity of working in your company.

\closing{Yours faithfully,}
